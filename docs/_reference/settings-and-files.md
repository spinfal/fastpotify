## Where things live

Fastpotify follows each platform's conventions. On Linux:

| What | Where | Safe to delete? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Settings | `~/.config/fastpotify/settings.json` | Yes, you lose preferences |
| Winamp skins | `~/.config/fastpotify/skins/` | Yes, you add them again |
| MilkDrop presets | `~/.config/fastpotify/milkdrop/` | Yes, you fetch them again |
| Shared Web API sign-in | `~/.local/state/fastpotify/shared_web_api_token.json` | Yes, you sign in again |
| Personal Web API sign-in | `~/.local/state/fastpotify/personal_web_api_token.json` | Yes, the personal app is disabled |
| Playback credential | `~/.local/state/fastpotify/credentials/` | Yes, you approve playback again |
| Last session | `~/.local/state/fastpotify/session.json` | Yes |
| Play history | `~/.local/state/fastpotify/history.json` | Yes |
| Audio cache | `~/.cache/fastpotify/audio/` | Always |
| Artwork cache | `~/.cache/fastpotify/art/` | Always |
| Lyrics cache | `~/.cache/fastpotify/lyrics/` | Always |
| Account-scoped playlist page cache | `~/.cache/fastpotify/playlists/<account-id>/` | Always |
| Last run's log | `~/.local/state/fastpotify/fastpotify.log` | Always |
| Crash log | `~/.local/state/fastpotify/panic.log` | Always |

Clearing caches never signs you out; credentials live in *state*, not
*cache*. Web API token files are written with owner-only permissions.
Signing out from Settings deletes both Web API grants and the separate
playback credential.

Progress through a playlist is periodically cached as a contiguous prefix.
When the playlist has not changed on Spotify, reopening it resumes from that
prefix instead of requesting the same pages again. Fastpotify validates the
cache against Spotify's playlist snapshot before showing it.
Successful playlist edits keep that loaded prefix and save it under Spotify's
new snapshot. Fastpotify reloads the playlist only if the write fails and the
optimistic edit must be reconciled.

The last good playlist folder tree is kept in `session.json`, scoped to the
account that supplied it. This keeps folders visible when local playback is
temporarily unavailable. Live session data is still required for edit grants.

The session remembers separate positions for the main window and the Winamp
mini player. The shade modes are kept in `settings.json`. Wayland compositors
may ignore saved positions. On Windows, a position
whose title bar is no longer on an available monitor's work area is discarded
when reopening the window, keeping its initial on-screen placement instead.

Large playlist pages also have a **Go to song** control. Entering a song
number loads its 50-item page directly, without requesting every earlier page.
Filtering or sorting still covers the whole playlist, so either action returns
to the beginning and loads the remaining pages as needed.

On macOS, settings, state, and the logs are in
`~/Library/Application Support/me.paolino.fastpotify` and the caches in
`~/Library/Caches/me.paolino.fastpotify`. On Windows, settings are in
`%APPDATA%\paolino\fastpotify\config`, state and the logs in
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\paolino\fastpotify\data`, and the caches in
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\paolino\fastpotify\cache`.

## settings.json

## Command line

```
fastpotify [OPTIONS] [LINK]

  LINK                  A Spotify link to open: spotify:track:…, or an
                        open.spotify.com address
  --device-name <NAME>  Spotify Connect name for this session
  -v, --verbose         More logs from librespot and the API client
```

A link goes to the running Fastpotify when there is one, which then opens
the page and brings its window forward; otherwise the app starts on it. The
desktop's handler for `spotify:` links runs exactly this.

Attach `fastpotify.log` from the state directory to bug reports. It contains
the last run's output, including extra lines from `fastpotify -v`. After a
crash, attach `panic.log` too.

## Demo mode

Builds made with `cargo build --features demo` accept `--demo`, which loads
sample data for screenshots and interface work. Demo mode never writes
settings.

`--demo-page` opens a page, such as `home`, `playlist:pl1`, or `artist:art0`,
and `--demo-show` adds surfaces on top of it: a comma separated list of
`queue`, `playing-next`, `devices`, `shortcuts`, `premium`, `create`, `duplicate`, `light`,
`focus`, `winamp`, `playlist`, `eq`, `eq-shade`, and `compact`.

`--demo-shot <PATH>` writes the window to a PNG and exits, which is useful for
making deterministic screenshots for these pages:

```
cargo run --release --features demo -- \
  --demo-shot docs/screenshot.png --demo-page playlist:pl1 --demo-show queue
```

The image uses the current window size. `--demo-size WIDTHxHEIGHT` sets that
size for a shot (for example `760x800` or `1240x800`). `--demo-shot-delay <MS>`
sets how long to wait for cover art before taking it.
